        <h1>1993 Mini Edition</h1>

        <h2>Gameplay Changes</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Wenda, Woof, and Waldo Watchers were added</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Cosmetic Changes</h2>

        By the early 90s additional artwork had been added underneath the postcard, so the scene could be used
        outside the context of the book (posters, puzzles, etc.):

        </div>

        A small tuft of green grass was added as part of the under-the-postcard scene can be seen in the 1993 edition,
        above the yellow car:

        <h1>Postcard Text</h1>

        The postcard text has been tweaked over the years:

        <h2>1987</h2>
        "Watch it, Waldo hunters! I'm an animal lover, that's for sure. I love that hippo with its alarm clock; that
        lion having its mane combed; the hat-eating giraffe; the owls in spectacles. Great! Now track me down, if you
        dare."

        <h2>1997</h2>
        "Watch it, Waldo hunters! I'm an animal lover, that's for sure. I love that hippo with its alarm clock; that
        lion having its mane combed; the hat-eating giraffe; the owls in spectacles. Great!"

        <h2>2017</h2>
        "Watch out, Waldo-hunters! I love all animalsâ€”that's for sure. I love that hippo with its alarm clock, that lion
        having its mane combed, that hat-eating giraffe, those owls in sunglasses. Great!"
