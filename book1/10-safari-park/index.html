        <h2>Under the Postcard</h2>
        By the early 90s additional artwork had been added underneath the postcard, so the scene could be used
        outside the context of the book (posters, puzzles, etc.):

        Starting in the 1993 edition, a small tuft of green grass that was added for the under-the-postcard scene can be seen,
        above the yellow car:

        <h2>Postcard Text</h2>

        <h3>1987</h3>
        Watch it, Waldo hunters! I'm an animal lover, that's for sure. I love that hippo with its alarm clock; that
        lion having its mane combed; the hat-eating giraffe; the owls in spectacles. Great! Now track me down, if you
        dare.

        <h3>1997</h3>
        Watch it, Waldo hunters! I'm an animal lover, that's for sure. I love that hippo with its alarm clock; that
        lion having its mane combed; the hat-eating giraffe; the owls in spectacles. Great!

        <h3>2012</h3>
        Watch out, Waldo-hunters! I love all animalsâ€”that's for sure. I love that hippo with its alarm clock, that lion
        having its mane combed, that hat-eating giraffe, those owls in sunglasses. Great!
