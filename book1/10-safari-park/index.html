## Postcard Text

The postcard text has been tweaked over the years:

**1987**
"Watch it, Waldo hunters! I'm an animal lover, that's for sure. I love that hippo with its alarm clock; that lion having its mane combed; the hat-eating giraffe; the owls in spectacles. Great! Now track me down, if you dare."

**1997**
"Watch it, Waldo hunters! I'm an animal lover, that's for sure. I love that hippo with its alarm clock; that lion having its mane combed; the hat-eating giraffe; the owls in spectacles. Great!"

**2017**
"Watch out, Waldo-hunters! I love all animalsâ€”that's for sure. I love that hippo with its alarm clock, that lion having its mane combed, that hat-eating giraffe, those owls in sunglasses. Great!"
