        <p>Originally, only Waldo and his lost bag were hidden on the beach.</p>

        <h1>1993 Mini Edition</h1>
        <h2>Gameplay Aditions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Wenda and Woof were added</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cosmetic Changes</h2>
        <p>By the early 90s, more detail was added to the bottom edge of the scene. Most likely so the scene could be used in merchandising
        with different aspect ratios. Some of the added detail is visible in this edition, though most is cut off by the page boundary.</p>

        <h1>2012 Deluxe Edition</h1>

        <h2>Political Correctness</h2>

        This scruffy character was cleaned up. He got a chin lift, and his arms were shortened:

        This smoker had his pipe removed:

            <img src="safari-smoke-1987.jpg"><img src="safari-smoke-2012.jpg">
        </div>

        This pudgy character was slimmed, and his hooked nose was redrawn:


        <div class="compare">
            <img src="safari-fat-1987.jpg"><img src="safari-fat-2012.jpg">
        </div>

        This woman got a chin lift:

            <img src="safari-fat2-1987.jpg"><img src="safari-fat2-2012.jpg">
        </div>

        This person's face was redrawn:

            <img src="safari-face-1987.jpg"><img src="safari-face-2012.jpg">
        </div>

        <h2>Diversity</h2>

        This man was changed to a woman:

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="safari-woman-1987.jpg"><img src="safari-woman-2012.jpg">
        </div>

        Several characters were changed to different races:

        <h2>Cosmetic Changes</h2>
        <p>The kid in the red hat was repositioned slightly to the left.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h1>Postcard</h1>
        <h2>Under the Postcard</h2>
        By the early 90s additional artwork had been added underneath the postcard, so the scene could be used
        outside the context of the book (posters, puzzles, etc.):
        <div class="compare">
            <img src="safari-postcard-reveal-2012.jpg">
        </div>

        Starting in the 1993 edition, a small tuft of green grass that was added for the under-the-postcard scene can be
        seen,
        above the yellow car:
        <div class="compare">
            <img class="postcard" src="safari-postcard-1987.jpg"><img class="postcard" src="safari-postcard-1993.jpg">
        </div>

        <h2>Postcard Text</h2>

        <h3>1987</h3>
        Watch it, Waldo hunters! I'm an animal lover, that's for sure. I love that hippo with its alarm clock; that
        lion having its mane combed; the hat-eating giraffe; the owls in spectacles. Great! Now track me down, if you
        dare.

        Watch out, Waldo-hunters! I love all animalsâ€”that's for sure. I love that hippo with its alarm clock, that lion
        having its mane combed, that hat-eating giraffe, those owls in sunglasses. Great!
