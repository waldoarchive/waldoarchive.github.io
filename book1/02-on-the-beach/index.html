        <p class="title">Where's Waldo: Scene 02 - On the Beach</p>

        <h1>Postcard</h1>

        The postcard text has been tweaked over the years:

        <h2>1987</h2>
        Greetings, Waldo followers! Wow, the beach was great today! I saw this girl stick ice cream in her brother's face, and there was a sand castle with a real knight in armor inside! Fantastic!

        <h2>1993</h2>
        Greetings, Waldo followers! Wow, the beach was great today! I saw this girl stick an ice cream in her brother's face, and there was a sand castle with a real knight in armour inside! Fantastic!

        <h2>2012</h2>
        Greetings, Waldo-followers! Wow, the beach was great today! All around me I saw stripes on towels, clothes, umbrellas, and beach huts. There was a sand castle with a real knight in armor inside! Fantastic!

        <h2>Under the Postcard</h2>    
        By the early 90s additional artwork had been added underneath the postcard, so the scene could be used
        outside the context of the book (posters, puzzles, etc.):

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-postcard-reveal-1991.jpg">
        </div>

        Starting the in the 1993 edition, you can see some of the new artwork peeking out of the bottom of the postcard. Traces of 4 new characters
        and a beach ball are present. The woman on the bottom-left had her bare feet covered with shoes:

        <div class="compare">
            <img class="postcard" src="beach-postcard-1987.jpg"><img class="postcard" src="beach-postcard-1993.jpg">
        </div>

    </div>
    <div class="section">

        <h1>1991 Magnificent Poster Book Edition</h1>
        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        Wenda, Woof, Waldo's key, and 6 Waldo Watchers were added.

        <h2>Cosmetic Changes</h2>

        A random object was added near the bags:

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-item-1987.jpg"><img src="beach-item-1991.jpg">
        </div>

        All the water lines were redrawn to make them more bold:

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-water-1987.jpg"><img src="beach-water-1991.jpg">
        </div>

    </div>

    <div class="section">

        <h1>1993 Mini Edition</h1>

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        Waldo was redrawn with the new character design, and an extra pair of legs were added to make him more obscured:

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-waldo-1991.jpg"><img src="beach-waldo-1993.jpg">
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h1>1997 Special Edition</h1>

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        Wizard Whitebeard, Odlaw, and the mystery character were added, along with the camera, bone, scroll, and binoculars. Waldo, Woof, and the snorkel were moved to a new location. The Waldo Watchers were redrawn.

        <h2>Political Correctness</h2>

        The most infamous example of censorship in the Waldo series. The bare-chested woman was covered with a bikini:

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-bikini-1991.jpg"><img src="beach-bikini-2012.jpg">
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h1>2012 Deluxe Edition</h1>

        <h2>Political Correctness</h2>

        The fat woman crushing a child was replaced with a man:

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-crush-1991.jpg"><img src="beach-crush-2012.jpg">
        </div>

        This Coppertone moment was removed. The dog is no longer biting the kid:

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-dog-1991.jpg"><img src="beach-dog-2012.jpg">
        </div>

        This guy is no longer getting poked in the eye:

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-poke-1991.jpg"><img src="beach-poke-2012.jpg">
        </div>

        This woman's cleavage was down-sized:

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-cleavage-1991.jpg"><img src="beach-cleavage-2012.jpg">
        </div>

        This woman's bikini is covering slightly more of her butt, and her hand was moved to be less suggestive:

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-woman-1991.jpg"><img src="beach-woman-2012.jpg">
        </div>

        <h2>Racial Changes</h2>

        The Arab kid building pyramids was replaced with a white kid, ruining the whole gag:

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-sandcastles-1991.jpg"><img src="beach-sandcastles-2012.jpg">
        </div>

        The races of these kids were swapped. The mischievous kids are now white instead of black:

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-kids-1991.jpg"><img src="beach-kids-2012.jpg">
        </div>

        The faces of two black people were redrawn, and an angry white woman was added alongside the angry black woman:

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-angry-1991.jpg"><img src="beach-angry-2012.jpg">
        </div>

        <h2>Drinking and Smoking</h2>

        Like all scenes in this book, all drinking and smoking was removed:

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-drinking-1991.jpg"><img src="beach-drinking-2012.jpg">
        </div>
        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-smoker-1991.jpg"><img src="beach-smoker-2012.jpg">
        </div>
        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-smoker2-1991.jpg"><img src="beach-smoker2-2012.jpg">
        </div>
        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-smoker3-1991.jpg"><img src="beach-smoker3-2012.jpg">
        </div>
        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-smoker4-1991.jpg"><img src="beach-smoker4-2012.jpg">
        </div>

        <h2>Cosmetic Changes</h2>

        The rolled-up umbrella has more blue:

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-umbrella-1991.jpg"><img src="beach-umbrella-2012.jpg">
        </div>

        Shadows around this woman's face were removed:

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-couple-1991.jpg"><img src="beach-couple-2012.jpg">
        </div>
    </div>
