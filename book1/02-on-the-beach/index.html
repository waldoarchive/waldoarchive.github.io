    <p class="title">Where's Waldo: Scene 02 - On the Beach</p>
    <h1>1993 Mini Edition</h1>
    <h2>Gameplay Changes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Characters were added to make Waldo more obscured</li>
        <li>Wenda, Woof, and Waldo Watchers were added</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cosmetic Changes</h2>
    Some cosmetic changes were made in this edition:
    <div>
    <ul>
        <li>Waldo's character design was updated.</li>
        <li>All the water lines were redrawn.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

    A random object was added near the bags:

    <div class="compare">
        <img src="beach-item-1987.jpg">
        <img src="beach-item-1991.jpg">
    </div>

    By 1993 additional artwork had been added underneath the postcard, so the scene could be used outside the context of the book (posters, puzzles, etc.):

    <div class="compare">
        <img class="postcard" src="beach-postcard-reveal-1991.jpg">
    </div>

    You can see some of the new artwork peeking out of the bottom of the postcard. The woman on the bottom-left had her bare feet covered with shoes:

    <div class="compare">
        <img class="postcard" src="beach-postcard-1987.jpg">
        <img class="postcard" src="beach-postcard-1993.jpg">
    </div>

    <h1>1997 Special Edition</h1>
    <h2>Gameplay Changes</h2>

    <div>
        <ul>
        <li>Waldo's location was changed</li>
        <li>Scuba mask location was changed</li>
        <li>Woof's location was changed</li>
        <li>Wizard Whitebeard and Odlaw were added</li>

        <li>Mystery character was added</li>
        <li>More Waldo Watchers were added</li>
    </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Political Correctness</h2>
    The most infamous change. The bare-chested woman was covered with a bikini:

    <div class="compare">
        <img src="beach-bikini-1991.jpg">
        <img src="beach-bikini-2012.jpg">
    </div>

    <h1>2012 Deluxe Edition</h1>

    <h2>Political Correctness</h2>

    The fat woman crushing a child was replaced with a man:

    <div class="compare">
        <img src="beach-crush-1991.jpg">
        <img src="beach-crush-2012.jpg">
    </div>

    This Coppertone moment was removed. The dog is no longer biting the kid's butt:

    <div class="compare">
        <img src="beach-dog-1991.jpg">
        <img src="beach-dog-2012.jpg">
    </div>

    This guy is no longer getting poked in the eye:

    <div class="compare">
        <img src="beach-poke-1991.jpg">
        <img src="beach-poke-2012.jpg">
    </div>

    This woman's cleavage was reduced:

    <div class="compare">
        <img src="beach-cleavage-1991.jpg">
        <img src="beach-cleavage-2012.jpg">
    </div>

    This woman's bikini is covering more of her butt, and her hand was moved to be less suggestive:

    <div class="compare">
        <img src="beach-woman-1991.jpg">
        <img src="beach-woman-2012.jpg">
    </div>

    <h2>Racial Changes</h2>

    The Arab kid building pyramids was replaced with a white kid, ruining the whole gag:

    <div class="compare">
        <img src="beach-sandcastles-1991.jpg">
        <img src="beach-sandcastles-2012.jpg">
    </div>

    The races of the kids were swapped. The mischievous kids are now white instead of black:

        <img src="beach-kids-1991.jpg">
        <img src="beach-kids-2012.jpg">
    </div>

    The faces of two black people were redrawn, and an angry white woman was added alongside the angry black woman:

    <div class="compare">
        <img src="beach-angry-1991.jpg">
        <img src="beach-angry-2012.jpg">
    </div>

    <h2>Drinking and Smoking</h2>

    Drinking and smoking were removed:

    <div class="compare">
        <img src="beach-drinking-1991.jpg">
        <img src="beach-drinking-2012.jpg">
    </div>

        <img src="beach-smoker3-2012.jpg">
    </div>


    <h2>Cosmetic Changes</h2>
    The rolled up umbrella has more blue:

        <img src="beach-umbrella-2012.jpg">
    </div>

    Shadows around this woman's face were removed:
