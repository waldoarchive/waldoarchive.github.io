        <p>Originally, only Waldo and his lost snorkel were hidden on the beach.</p>

        </ul>
        <h2>Cosmetic Changes</h2>

        All of the waves and ripples in the water were redrawn to be slightly more bold:

            <img src="beach-water-1987.jpg"><img src="beach-water-1991.jpg">
        </div>
        A random object was added near the bags:

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-item-1987.jpg"><img src="beach-item-1991.jpg">
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

        <h1>1993 Mini Edition</h1>

        <p>Waldo was redrawn with the new character design, and an extra pair of legs were added to further obscure him:
        </p>

        <h2>Early Censorship</h2>

        This edition introduced the most infamous example of censorship in the Waldo series. The bare-chested woman was
        covered with a bikini:

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-bikini-1991.jpg"><img src="beach-bikini-2012.jpg">
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h1>2012 Deluxe Edition</h1>

        <h2>The Rise of Political Correctness</h2>

        The fat woman crushing a child was replaced with a man:

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-crush-1991.jpg"><img src="beach-crush-2012.jpg">
        </div>

        This Coppertone moment was removed. The dog is no longer biting the kid:

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-dog-1991.jpg"><img src="beach-dog-2012.jpg">
        </div>

        This guy is no longer getting poked in the eye:

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-poke-1991.jpg"><img src="beach-poke-2012.jpg">
        </div>

        This woman's cleavage was down-sized:

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-cleavage-1991.jpg"><img src="beach-cleavage-2012.jpg">
        </div>

        This woman's bikini bottoms are covering slightly more, and her hand was moved to be less suggestive:

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-woman-1991.jpg"><img src="beach-woman-2012.jpg">
        </div>

        <h2>Racial Changes</h2>

        The Arab kid building pyramids was replaced with a white kid, draining the humor from of the gag:

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-sandcastles-1991.jpg"><img src="beach-sandcastles-2012.jpg">
        </div>

        The races of these kids were swapped. The mischievous kids are now white instead of black:

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-kids-1991.jpg"><img src="beach-kids-2012.jpg">
        </div>

        The faces of two black people were redrawn, and an angry white woman was added alongside the angry black woman:

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-angry-1991.jpg"><img src="beach-angry-2012.jpg">
        </div>

        <h2>Drinking and Smoking</h2>

        All drinking and smoking was removed from the scene:

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-drinking-1991.jpg"><img src="beach-drinking-2012.jpg">
        </div>
        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-smoker-1991.jpg"><img src="beach-smoker-2012.jpg">
        </div>
        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-smoker2-1991.jpg"><img src="beach-smoker2-2012.jpg">
        </div>
        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-smoker3-1991.jpg"><img src="beach-smoker3-2012.jpg">
        </div>
        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-smoker4-1991.jpg"><img src="beach-smoker4-2012.jpg">
        </div>

        <h2>Cosmetic Changes</h2>

        The rolled-up umbrella has an extra blue stripe:

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-umbrella-1991.jpg"><img src="beach-umbrella-2012.jpg">
        </div>

        Shadows around this woman's face were removed:

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-couple-1991.jpg"><img src="beach-couple-2012.jpg">
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

        <h1>Postcard</h1>

        <h2>Under the Postcard</h2>
        <p>By the early 90s additional artwork had been added underneath the postcard, so the scene could be used
        outside the context of the book (posters, puzzles, etc.):</p>

        <img src="beach-postcard-reveal-1991.jpg">

        <p>Starting the in the 1993 edition, you can see some of the new artwork peeking out of the bottom of the
            postcard. Traces of 4 new characters
            and a beach ball are present. The woman on the bottom-left had her bare feet covered with shoes:</p>

        <div class="compare">
            <img class="postcard" src="beach-postcard-1987.jpg"><img class="postcard" src="beach-postcard-1993.jpg">
        </div>
