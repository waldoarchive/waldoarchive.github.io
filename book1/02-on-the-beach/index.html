        All of the waves and ripples in the water were redrawn to be slightly more bold:

            <img src="beach-water-1987.jpg"><img src="beach-water-1991.jpg">
        </div>
        A random object was added near the bags:

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-item-1987.jpg"><img src="beach-item-1991.jpg">
        </div>
    </div>

        <h1>1993 Mini Edition</h1>

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        Waldo was redrawn with the new character design, and an extra pair of legs were added to further obscure him:

        Wizard Whitebeard, Odlaw, and the mystery character were added, along with the camera, bone, scroll, and binoculars. Waldo, Woof, and the snorkel were moved to new locations. 
        The Waldo Watchers were redrawn, but none were added.

        <h2>Early Censorship</h2>

        This edition introduced the most infamous example of censorship in the Waldo series. The bare-chested woman was covered with a bikini:

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-bikini-1991.jpg"><img src="beach-bikini-2012.jpg">
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h1>2012 Deluxe Edition</h1>

        <h2>The Rise of Political Correctness</h2>

        The fat woman crushing a child was replaced with a man:

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-crush-1991.jpg"><img src="beach-crush-2012.jpg">
        </div>

        This Coppertone moment was removed. The dog is no longer biting the kid:

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-dog-1991.jpg"><img src="beach-dog-2012.jpg">
        </div>

        This guy is no longer getting poked in the eye:

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-poke-1991.jpg"><img src="beach-poke-2012.jpg">
        </div>

        This woman's cleavage was down-sized:

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-cleavage-1991.jpg"><img src="beach-cleavage-2012.jpg">
        </div>

        This woman's bikini bottoms are covering slightly more, and her hand was moved to be less suggestive:

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-woman-1991.jpg"><img src="beach-woman-2012.jpg">
        </div>

        <h2>Racial Changes</h2>

        The Arab kid building pyramids was replaced with a white kid, ruining the whole gag:

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-sandcastles-1991.jpg"><img src="beach-sandcastles-2012.jpg">
        </div>

        The races of these kids were swapped. The mischievous kids are now white instead of black:

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-kids-1991.jpg"><img src="beach-kids-2012.jpg">
        </div>

        The faces of two black people were redrawn, and an angry white woman was added alongside the angry black woman:

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-angry-1991.jpg"><img src="beach-angry-2012.jpg">
        </div>

        <h2>Drinking and Smoking</h2>

        All drinking and smoking was removed from the scene:

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="beach-drinking-1991.jpg"><img src="beach-drinking-2012.jpg">
        </div>

        </div>

        <h2>Cosmetic Changes</h2>

        The rolled-up umbrella has an extra blue stripe:

        </div>

        Shadows around this woman's face were removed:

        <h1>Postcard</h1>

        The postcard text has been tweaked over the years:

        <h2>1987</h2>
        Greetings, Waldo followers! Wow, the beach was great today! I saw this girl stick ice cream in her brother's face, and there was a sand castle with a real knight in armor inside! Fantastic!

        <h2>1993</h2>
        Greetings, Waldo followers! Wow, the beach was great today! I saw this girl stick an ice cream in her brother's face, and there was a sand castle with a real knight in armour inside! Fantastic!

        <h2>2012</h2>
        Greetings, Waldo-followers! Wow, the beach was great today! All around me I saw stripes on towels, clothes, umbrellas, and beach huts. There was a sand castle with a real knight in armor inside! Fantastic!

        <h2>Under the Postcard</h2>    
        By the early 90s additional artwork had been added underneath the postcard, so the scene could be used
        outside the context of the book (posters, puzzles, etc.):

            <img src="beach-postcard-reveal-1991.jpg">

        Starting the in the 1993 edition, you can see some of the new artwork peeking out of the bottom of the postcard. Traces of 4 new characters
        and a beach ball are present. The woman on the bottom-left had her bare feet covered with shoes:
