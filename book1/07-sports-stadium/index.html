        <h2>Early Censorship</h2>

        The infamous streaker was given a speedo. The women are still recoiling, and the police are still chasing him,
        which makes less sense after the edit:

        <h1>2012 Deluxe Edition</h1>

        <h2>The Rise of Political Correctness</h2>

        <p>The half-black and half-white man was removed. The characters marveling over him were flipped, since he's no
            longer an interesting subject:</p>

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="stadium-half-1987.jpg"><img src="stadium-half-2017.jpg">
        </div>

        <p>This scene was altered to make it more clear that the javelins are going through the umpire's clothes.
            He was also changed from black to white:</p>

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="stadium-javelin-1987.jpg"><img src="stadium-javelin-2017.jpg">
        </div>

        <p>This umpire was changed from white to black:</p>

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="stadium-race-1987.jpg"><img src="stadium-race-2017.jpg">
        </div>

        <p>This umpire's starter pistols were redrawn to look less like real guns:</p>

        <div class="compare small">
            <img src="stadium-gun-1987.jpg"><img src="stadium-gun-2012.jpg">
        </div>

        <p>This umpire's starter pistol was removed entirely. The squirt gun was kept, but the races of the kids were
            flipped, so it's now being shot by the white kid:</p>

        <div class="compare small">
            <img src="stadium-gun2-1987.jpg"><img src="stadium-gun2-2012.jpg">
        </div>

        <p>Fat people were slimmed down:</p>

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="stadium-fat2-1987.jpg"><img src="stadium-fat2-2012.jpg">
        </div>

        </div>

        <h2>More Political Correctness</h2>

        <p>Violence against women was removed. This woman is no longer getting punched in the back of the head:</p>

        <div class="compare">
            <img src="stadium-punch-1987.jpg"><img src="stadium-punch-2012.jpg">
        </div>

        <p>In this case, the woman being assaulted was changed to a man. In fact, this is the author Martin Handfordâ€”he
            inserted himself as the victim in several controversial gags. You'll also find him in the Camp Site and Department Store:</p>

        </div>

        <p>This guy's arms were shortened, and his chin was alterd:</p>

        <h1>2017 30th Anniversary Edition</h1>
        <h2>Legal Changes</h2>

        References to the red cross were removed:

        <h2>Racial Changes</h2>

        Nearly every black character had their face altered in this edition. At least 24 were redrawn:

        <h1>Postcard</h1>

        The postcard text has been tweaked over the years:

        <h2>1987</h2>
        On your marks, Waldo champions! What a track meet! What a riot! Look at that umpire pinned down by javelins!
        Look at that pole vaulter breaking his pole! Look at that very tall high jumper! Look at me!

        <h2>1993</h2>
        On your marks, Waldo champions! What a sports day! What a riot! Look at that umpire pinned down by javelins!
        Look at that pole vaulter breaking his pole! Look at that very tall high jumper! Look at me!

        <h2>1997</h2>
        On your marks, Waldo champions! What a sports day! What a riot! Look at that umpire pinned down by javelins!
        Look at that pole vaulter breaking his pole! Look at that very tall high jumper!

        <h2>2012</h2>
        On your marks, Waldo-champions! What a sports day! What a scene! Look at all those javelins everywhere! Look at
        that pole vaulter breaking his pole! Look at those two masses of runners racing towards each other!

        <h2>2017</h2>
        On your marks, Waldo-champions! What a sports day! What a scene! Look at all those javelins everywhere! Look at
