<h2>1987</h2>
Roll up, Waldo fun lovers! Maybe you noticed already, and maybe you didn't—but I've lost all my things. Now we all have to go back to the beginning and find out what I lost and where it is—one thing in every place. Wow!

<h2>1997</h2>
Roll up, Waldo fun lovers! Wow! I've lost all my things, one in every place. Now you have to go back and find them. And somewhere one of the Waldo-Watchers has lost the bobble from his hat. Can you spot which one, and find the missing bobble?

<h2>2017</h2>
Step right up, Waldo-fun lovers! I've lost all my things, one in every place I've visited. Go back and find them! And somewhere one of the Waldo-Watchers has lost a pom-pom from his hat. Can you spot which one, and find the missing pom-pom?

Now keep going! From here there's one final stop on my journey, back in town again! But a lot has changed there. Can you spot all the differences and find where everything new has come from?
