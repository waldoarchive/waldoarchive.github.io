        <h1>2014 Deluxe Edition</h1>

        This is the only scene in the Deluxe Edition to not have any censored content!

        <h2>Cosmetic Changes</h2>

        <p>This assassination scene was repositioned ever so slightly, likely to prevent it from being cut off at the page boundary:</p>

        <p>The guy giving a thumbs-up at the edge of the page was also repositioned slightly:</p>

        <h1>History Book</h1>

        <h2>1988</h2>
        <p>The Romans spent most of their time fighting, conquering, learning Latin and making roads. They always had games at the Coliseum. Their favorite games were fighting, chariot racing, fighting, and feeding Christians to the lions. When the crowd gave a gladiator the thumbs down, it meant kill your opponent. Thumbs up meant let him go. Thumbs up for you if you can find me at the games.</p>

        <h2>2014</h2>
        <p>The Romans spent most of their time fighting, conquering, learning Latin and making roads. When they took their holidays, they also had games at the Coliseum (an old sort of playground). Their favorite games were fighting, more fighting, chariot racing, fighting, and feeding Christians to lions. When the crowd gave a gladiator the thumbs-down, it meant he should kill his opponent. A thumbs-up meant he should let him goâ€”to fight to the death another day.</p>

        <h2>Under the Book</h2>
        <p>By the early 90s additional artwork had been added underneath the book, so the scene could be used
            outside the context of the book (posters, puzzles, etc.):</p>

        <img src="rome-book-reveal-2014.jpg">

        <p>Starting the in the 1994 edition, you can see some of the new artwork peeking around the sides of the book, particularly above in the bleachers:
