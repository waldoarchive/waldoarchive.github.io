        <h1>History Book</h1>

        <h2>1988</h2>
        <p>The Aztecs lived in sunny Mexico and were rich and strong
            and liked swinging from poles pretending to be eagles. They
            also liked making human sacrifices to their gods, so it
            was best to agree with everything they said. The Spanish
            were also rich and strong and some of them, called
            conquistadores, came to Mexico to find gold. They thought
            the Aztecs a complete nuisance. Get swinging and find me in
            Mexico.</p>

        <h2>2014</h2>
        <p>The Aztecs lived in sunny Mexico and were rich and strong

            also liked making human sacrifices to their gods, so it

            were also rich and strong, and some of them, called
            conquistadors, came to Mexico in 1519 to have an adventure.
            However, when the Aztecs and Spanish met, they did not agree
            on much.</p>

        <h2>Under the Book</h2>
        <p>By the early 90s additional artwork had been added underneath the book, so the scene could be used
            outside the context of the book (posters, puzzles, etc.):</p>

        <p>Starting the in the 1994 edition, you can see some of the new artwork peeking out of the bottom of the book:
