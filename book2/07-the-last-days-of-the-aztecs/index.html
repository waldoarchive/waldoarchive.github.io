        <h1>History Book</h1>

        The book text has been tweaked over the years:

        <h2>1988</h2>
        The Aztecs lived in sunny Mexico and were rich and strong
        and liked swinging from poles pretending to be eagles. They
        also liked making human sacrifices to their gods, so it
        was best to agree with everything they said. The Spanish
        were also rich and strong and some of them, called
        conquistadores, came to Mexico to find gold. They thought
        the Aztecs a complete nuisance. Get swinging and find me in
        Mexico.

        <h2>2014</h2>
        The Aztecs lived in sunny Mexico and were rich and strong
        and liked swinging from poles, pretending to be eagles. They
        also liked making human sacrifices to their gods, so it
        was best to agree with everything they said. The Spanish
        were also rich and strong, and some of them, called
        conquistadors, came to Mexico in 1519 to have an adventure.
        However, when the Aztecs and Spanish met, they did not agree
        on much.

        <h2>Under the Book</h2>    
        By the early 90s additional artwork had been added underneath the book, so the scene could be used
        outside the context of the book (posters, puzzles, etc.):

        Starting the in the 1994 edition, you can see some of the new artwork peeking out of the bottom of the book:
